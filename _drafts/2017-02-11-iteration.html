    <p>"Iterating" the function \(z^2+c\). Use right and left arrows to increase and decrease \(c\).</p>

    <p>In this example \(c\) and \(z\) are initially \(0\).</p>

    <p>Iteration, in this context means "plug in repeatedly". So we pick a number \(c\), and then take our initial value \(z\).</p>

    <p>Next, we calculate the new value for \(z\) based on our old value of \(z\) by plugging the old value of \(z\) into \(z^2+c\).</p>

    <p>This seamingly simple method is the basis for creating a wide varietly of fractals, most notably the Mandelbrot set!</p>
