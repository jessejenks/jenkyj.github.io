This past summer I got to work with Professor Douglas Cannon to write a paper on John Etchemendy's book, *The Concept of Logical Consequence*. As soon as the school journal publishes it, a link to the paper will appear here.

In the early 20-th century, people like Hilbert wanted to secure a logical foundation for mathematics. Russell and Whitehead famously wrote *Principia Mathematica* in which they attempted to axiomatize much of mathematics. They even have a proof that 1+1=2!

In the meantime, [here](/../../../../data/logic_poster.pdf) is a poster I made for the research symposium
