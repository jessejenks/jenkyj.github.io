This past summer I got to work with Professor Douglas Cannon to write a paper on John Etchemendy's book, *The Concept of Logical Consequence*. As soon as the school journal publishes it, a link to the paper will appear here. Be warned, I find this topic fascinating and the paper ended up being very long!

In the meantime, [here](/../data/logic_poster.pdf) is a poster I made for the research symposium:
