Suppose someone hands you a square sheet of paper with a diagonal drawn from the bottom left to the top right. Here's the challenge: by only cutting and rearranging the pieces of the paper *without rotating any of the pieces*, can you completely reverse the diagonal? That is, can you turn the original diagonal into the diagonal from top left to bottom right?
