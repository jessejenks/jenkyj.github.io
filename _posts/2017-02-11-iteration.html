"Iterating" the function \(z^2+c\). Use right and left arrows to increase and decrease \(c\).

In this example \(c\) and \(z\) are initially \(0\).

Use your arrow keys to vary \(c\)!

Iteration, in this context means "plug in repeatedly".
So we pick a number \(c\), and then take our initial value \(z\).

Next, we calculate the new value for \(z\) based on our old value of \(z\) by plugging the old value of \(z\) into \(z^2+c\).

This seamingly simple method is the basis for creating a wide varietly of fractals, most notably the Mandelbrot set!
