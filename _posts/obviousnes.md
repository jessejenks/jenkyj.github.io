What do we mean when we say something is *obvious*? If a proposition is obvious, does that mean it is logically necessary that the proposition be true? Or does it simply mean that it is rational to believe that it is true? On top of this, "obvious" implies that it takes little to no effort for a rational person to see that the proposition be true.
